        <p>Model United Nations (MUN) is an educational simulation in which students role-play as delegates <br>
            to the United Nations and simulate UN committees or other international organizations. <br>
            These conferences are organized by schools, universities, or independent MUN organizations. <br>
            MUN committees are the core components of these conferences, and each committee typically focuses <br>
            on a specific topic or issue related to international relations, diplomacy, and global affairs. <br>
            The purpose of MUN committees is to simulate the work of real-world international organizations and <br>
            provide participants with an opportunity .Each conference has a variety of committees which look <br>
            into different agendas. Each committee has specific characteristics and participants need to understand <br>
             their committee well. <br> </p></span>

                The Security Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
                security. It has 15 Members, and each Member has one vote. Under the Charter of the United Nations,
                all Member States are obligated to comply with Council decisions. The Security Council takes the
                lead in determining the existence of a threat to the peace or act of aggression. It calls upon the
                parties to a dispute to settle it by peaceful means and recommends methods of adjustment or terms
                of settlement. In some cases, the Security Council can resort to imposing sanctions or even
                authorize the use of force to maintain or restore international peace and security.</p>
